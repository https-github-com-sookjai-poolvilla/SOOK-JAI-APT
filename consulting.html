What is the Foreign Business Act?<br><br>
  
Introduced in 1999, the Foreign Business Act is the predominant legislation by which all foreign businesses operating in Thailand must abide. <br>
According to the act, a business is recognized as foreign if it meets the following criteria:<br><br>

If it has been established under a foreign law;<br>
If foreigners own half or the majority of the business’ capital; <br>and
If foreign investors have contributed half or more of the capital.<br><br>
According to the Foreign Business Act, for foreigners to legally operate in the country, they must acquire a business operation permit from the Director-General<br>
of the Department of Commercial Registration and have it approved by the Foreign Business Committee. Only then can they begin to register a Thai company and operate as a separate legal entity. <br>

What Businesses Can Foreigners Enter into?<br><br>
  
The approval requirement takes into consideration the business category under which foreigners can operate. <br>
Based on Foreign Business Act B.E. 2542, there are three main business categories in the country, mainly:<br><br>

List 1<br>
Businesses under List 1 include industries relating to national safety and security. As such, these are prohibited to foreigners. <br>
Unless a special treaty has been issued, an exemption to this list cannot be granted. <br><br>

List 2<br>
Businesses under List 2 include industries in culture and arts. <br>
These are reserved primarily for Thai nationals and are not open to new foreigners. <br>
However, foreign-owned businesses that have existed and operated under this category prior to the enactment of <br>
the Foreign Business Act are granted a special Business License and are permitted to continue their operations.<br><br>

List 3<br>
Businesses in List 3 include the environment and natural resources. <br>
These are businesses in which Thai entrepreneurs are not yet ready to venture into. As such, these businesses are open to foreign investors and entrepreneurs. <br>
Although a Foreign Business License is required, foreigners can have 100% of the total business shares and can operate independently.<br><br>

How do you Obtain 100% Foreign Business Ownership?<br><br>
  
There are three methods to own 100% of the foreign business under Thai Law. <br>

Receive the Board of Investment (BOI) Promotion<br><br>
The Thailand Board of Investment aims to encourage more foreign investors to decentralize the industrial base while contributing to the country’s overall economic growth. <br>
When a company is certified with the BOI, it can experience major advantages such as beneficial tax waivers, faster processing time for work permits, and the ability to own land. <br>
Businesses that operate under certain industries are qualified to apply for the BOI Promotion. <br>
These include foreign-owned businesses in agriculture, mining, transportation, technology, and public utilities. <br><br>

Register through the Treaty of Amity (limited to American citizens only)<br><br>
This treaty between Thailand and the United States permits American-owned companies and corporations to acquire a majority of the shares or <br>
completely own the company, the branch, or the representative office. <br>
The process to register through the treaty is complex and time-consuming, which is why the best course of action is to consult with an attorney or a business services provider.<br><br>

Obtain Foreign Business License<br><br>
To obtain a foreign business license, the applicant must be more than 20 years of age. <br>
He/she has a residency in Thailand under the laws of immigration, is financially stable, and has never been punished or imprisoned by the court. <br>
Additionally, he/she must abide by the Foreign Business Act and acquire a minimum capital that should be remitted back to the country.<br><br>

What are the Minimum Capital Requirements for Foreign Businesses?<br><br>
In addition to complying with the Business Categories, the law also requires that foreign businesses maintain a minimum amount of total capital, which can be one of two options.<br>

If the foreign company falls under a non-specified business category, the minimum requirement is 2 million Baht. However, <br>
if the company operates under any of the lists of industries mentioned in the Foreign Business Act, the minimum requirement is increased to 3 million Baht.<br>

Why Do Foreigners Need to Hire Professional Services?<br><br>
Dealing with the requirements and complying with the Foreign Business Act can be challenging, especially for first-time business owners.<br> 
You need the guidance of expert professionals who have acquired years of expertise and experience in the field of business to guide you through the whole process<br>
from company registration to operation. That’s the sure way to succeed.<br>
